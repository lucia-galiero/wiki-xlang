A meeting point, meeting place, assembly point, or muster point is a geographically defined place where people meet. Such a meeting point is often a landmark that has become popular and is a convenient place for both tourists and citizens to meet. Examples of meeting points include public areas and facilities such as squares, statues, parks, amusement parks, railway stations, airports, etc. or officially designated and signed points in such public facilities. There is often a public sign designating an official meeting point in public facilities (see illustrations).
Especially when referred to as an assembly point or muster point, a meeting point can be a designated safe place where people can gather or must report to during an emergency or drill.
In sociology, a meeting point is a place where a group of people meet on a regular basis, for example, a group of regulars or people with a special interest or background. These meeting points are in designated private rooms, in a part of a park, or in a café.
