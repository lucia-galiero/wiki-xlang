Fregula (often incorrectly written fregola) is a type of pasta from the Sardinia region of Italy. It is similar to North African berkoukes, Levantine moghrabieh, and Middle Eastern couscous. Fregula comes in varying sizes, but typically consists of semolina dough that has been rolled into balls 2â€“3 mm in diameter and toasted in an oven.
A typical preparation of fregula is to simmer it in a tomato-based sauce with clams.
